Product Requirements Document: Order Processing Integration Prepared For: E-Commerce Platform – Engineering Team
Version: 1.1
1. Overview
This document outlines the requirements for integrating the Sales and Delivery systems to support a full order  lifecycle within a large-scale e-commerce platform. Each department operates its own application, and this  initiative aims to implement a reliable and robust communication flow between them.
2. Objectives
• Allow the Sales department to receive and process customer orders.
• Ensure product availability before confirming orders.
• Store and track order information across its lifecycle.
• Initiate delivery workflows upon order creation.
• Receive delivery status updates to keep order states synchronized.
3. Functional Requirements
3.1 Order Creation (Sales Application)
• Sales exposes a secure API endpoint to receive incoming customer orders.
• When an order is received:
o Validate input data.
o Check product availability.
o If available:
▪ Create the order in the Sales database.
▪ Assign a unique order ID.
▪ Set the order status to "Pending Shipment".
▪ Initiate the delivery process.
▪ Return the order ID to the customer.

3.2 Communication Between Systems
• Upon order creation, the Sales application must communicate with other systems regarding new order details.
• The Delivery application begins the shipment processing once getting order details. 3.3 Delivery Notifications (Delivery → Sales)
• The Delivery application sends updates to the Sales system:
o When the order is shipped.
o When the order is delivered.
• These updates should update the order status in the Sales system accordingly ("Shipped" and  "Delivered").
4. Non-Functional Requirements
• Reliability: Communication between services must tolerate transient failures and ensure eventual  consistency.
• Scalability: The system must support high throughput during peak ordering hours. • Idempotency: Status updates and event handling must be designed to handle duplicate messages safely. • Security: All APIs and messages must be securely authenticated and authorized (Nice to have) • Observability: Systems should log key events and expose metrics for monitoring flow health. (Nice to  have)
5. Out of Scope
• Payment handling and validation.
• Inventory reservation or warehouse logistics.
6. Success Criteria
• All valid orders receive a confirmed order ID.
• Order delivery status changes are reflected in the Sales system reliably and promptly. • Delivery status changes are reflected in the Delivery system reliably and promptly.
